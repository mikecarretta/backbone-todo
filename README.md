# Todo App

## Learning backbone.js and underscore.js

Broken apart, re-styled using Bootstrap and re-assembled by [me](https://github.com/mikecarretta); trying to understand how to create a backbone.js app. This todo app is based on the [TodoMVC Backbone.js app](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/).

Using the [Developing Backbone.js Applications](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/) book by [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani).
